## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- css Variables

### What I learned

For this project what I wanted to learn was how to use css variables. By adding variables in css we are able to use the same value
multiple times in the page, so in case we want to make a change on the styling of some element on the page with the help of variables
we only need to change a single value instead of looking in the whole document instances of that value and replacing them one by one.
Also something new I learned with this project is that use of the DOM, to get a value from a form and be able to display it on another 
page.
